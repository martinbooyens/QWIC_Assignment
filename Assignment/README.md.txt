# Embedded Systems Tech Assignment

In this assignment, we will use a development board to test your proficiency with HW and IoT connectivity. 

## Goal: CTF
With the ESP32 board, you will try to connect to an MQTT topic in AWS IoT Core. Your goal is to read a message that is being published every 5 seconds.


## Credentials

You will get your credentials over email. Then you should use the following:

```
topic:  "qwic/assignment"

endpoint: "abbdzu9q7kew3-ats.iot.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"

Thing_name: "Martin"
```


# Deliverables: 
The code of your implementation should be sent as a repository (github or similar) along with a readme.

# Evaluation is based on 
- Implementation of the exercise.
- Language used.
- General coding skills
- extras.
